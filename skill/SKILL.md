# instsci

## Core Rule

Use this skill as the project entry point for InstSci work. The implementation and project-specific rules live in the repository root containing `AGENTS.md` and `pyproject.toml`.

## Startup

1. Work from the InstSci repository root unless the user explicitly names another checkout.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` before changing behavior or reporting publisher PDF results.
3. For continuation, recall, migration, or "previous task" questions, use the `chatmem` skill/MCP first. Treat indexed history as evidence, not approved startup rules.
4. For publisher PDF, closed-access, institution-login, or capability-matrix tasks, also read `instsci/data/institutional_identity_policy.json` or run:

```powershell
instsci identity-policy
```

## MCP Coordination

When InstSci MCP tools are available, use them as the structured context bridge before reading raw JSON files by hand:

- `get_institutional_identity_policy`: load route-selection policy before closed-access planning.
- `get_publisher_access_catalog`: inspect publisher route templates, login hints, persistence stores, and HTTP preflight limits.
- `get_publisher_browser_verification_matrix`: inspect prior browser-backed publisher evidence.
- `plan_publisher_pdf_workflow`: build the correct visible CLI command and identify whether a subscription institution is still required.

Use MCP `search_papers`, `get_paper_metadata`, and `fetch_paper` for metadata, Open Access lookup, DOI resolution, or non-final retrieval attempts. For publisher PDF downloads, closed-access verification, capability matrices, or final support verdicts, MCP is planning/context only; the actual evidence must come from the visible CloakBrowser workflow started by `instsci papers`, `instsci publisher-batch`, `PublisherBatchDownloader`, or `ACSCloakBatchDownloader`.

If MCP output and repository files disagree, treat `AGENTS.md` plus `instsci/data/*.json` as the source of truth and mention the mismatch.

## Evidence Standard

Final publisher PDF verdicts require the visible built-in CloakBrowser workflow. `curl`, `requests`, DOI resolution, `publisher-doctor`, route construction, logs, DOM state, URLs, and cookie exports are HTTP preflight only.

Accepted browser-backed routes include:

```powershell
instsci papers dois.txt --publisher auto --institution "Institution Name" --output .\runs\papers
instsci publisher-batch dois.txt --publisher acs --institution "Institution Name" --output .\runs\acs
```

Code-level work may use `PublisherBatchDownloader`, `ACSCloakBatchDownloader`, or the same visible built-in browser context.

## Elsevier API Setup

For Elsevier or ScienceDirect DOI retrieval, guide the user to configure a global Elsevier API key once:

```powershell
instsci elsevier-setup --api-key YOUR_ELSEVIER_KEY --validate
```

- The key is global InstSci config, not per article; `--test-doi` is validation only.
- Inst Token is optional. Configure `--inst-token` only when the user's library explicitly provides an Elsevier institutional token.
- The preferred API route is `view=FULL XML -> object/eid -> PDF`.
- Use direct-first routing so `api.elsevier.com` can use campus, school VPN, rule VPN, or library exit before any configured proxy fallback.
- Do not write API keys, Inst Tokens, cookies, or entitlement details into docs, logs, skill files, or commits.
- API success is HTTP preflight/API-route evidence. Final publisher PDF verdicts still require visible CloakBrowser evidence when the task asks for closed-access publisher capability.

## Institution Route

- Do not default to Example University or any other school.
- Resolve subscription institution in this order: explicit `--institution`, `config.carsi_idp_name`, `config.school`, then ask the user.
- Prefer publisher broker, Shibboleth, OpenAthens, CARSI, or configured WAYFless institution links before WebVPN.
- Use WebVPN only when the configured institution has a WebVPN gateway and that route is browser-verified for the publisher.
- Do not treat `cookies.json` or `carsi_cookie_dir/*.json` as a full reusable login state; they are preflight/supporting assets, not final evidence.

## Reporting

For publisher PDF work, report each DOI or publisher with `publisher`, `doi`, `route_attempted`, `institution`, `file_status`, `standard_status`, `result_evidence`, `evidence`, and `next_action`.

Use the three-layer status contract:

- `file_status`: file outcome only. Allowed values are `success`, `unverified`, and `missing`.
- `standard_status`: user/workflow meaning. Common values are `success`, `auth_required`, `access_unavailable`, `waf_blocked`, `human_verification_required`, `publisher_error`, `capture_failed`, `unsupported_publisher`, and `pdf_candidate_conflict`.
- `result_evidence`: how the result was established. Allowed values are `oa_direct`, `publisher_open_pdf`, `browser_verified`, `http_preflight`, and `not_verified`.

For final manifests, keep Markdown, CSV, and JSON counts consistent. `file_status=success` means downloaded and verified; `file_status=unverified` means a PDF exists but DOI/text verification is insufficient; `file_status=missing` means no PDF was captured. HTTP-only findings are never final closed-access verdicts; final publisher conclusions require `result_evidence=browser_verified`.

## Zotero Sync

After `papers` or `publisher-batch` writes a run manifest, keep Zotero as the long-term paper entry point:

```powershell
instsci zotero handoff .\runs\papers --tags project/my-topic --collections "Collection Name"
instsci zotero sync .\runs\papers --attachment-mode linked_file
```

`handoff` builds the reviewable action queue. `sync` creates or matches the Zotero item, links the matching local PDF as a `linked_file` attachment, writes `zotero_item_key` and `zotero_attachment_key` back into the InstSci manifest, and writes `zotero_sync_report.json`.

Default sync behavior includes only `standard_status=success` rows and requires an existing PDF. Zotero remains clean: item plus PDF attachment only. Do not create Zotero child notes, evidence notes, or process logs.

Use Zotero Storage uploads only when the user explicitly wants imported attachments and has enough Zotero storage. The stable default is `linked_file`, which also works well with Zotero Attanger-style local attachment management.

## Workflow Plan

After a run with failures or unresolved rows, generate a structured next-step acquisition plan:

```powershell
instsci workflow-plan .\runs\papers
```

`workflow-plan` reads the manifest, excludes success rows by default, and writes `workflow_plan.json` beside the manifest. Each attention item keeps the existing `next_action` and adds machine-readable `suggested_paths`, such as `oa_retry`, `library_resolver`, `ill_request`, `author_email`, `rerun_diagnose`, or `manual_browser_single_doi`.

Use this plan to decide the next research workflow. Keep Zotero focused on items and PDFs; keep acquisition process state in InstSci manifests and reports.

## Publisher Matrix

Before running large closed-access batches, inspect publisher readiness with the matrix panel:

```powershell
instsci publisher-doctor --matrix
```

`publisher-doctor --matrix` is a planning view, not a fresh access verdict. It summarizes the local publisher capability matrix with `ready`, `prewarm_required`, `waf_risky`, `unsupported`, `batch_recommendation`, `known_blocker`, and machine-readable `suggested_paths`.

Use this panel to decide whether to run a normal batch, run a single-DOI prewarm first, switch to a manual browser check, retry later, or avoid a bulk run. For final publisher PDF verdicts, still use the visible CloakBrowser-backed workflow.

## Detailed Reference

For recent gotchas, publisher-specific notes, visible-browser UI fallback steps, report-count rules, and verification commands, read `references/publisher-pdf-workflow.md` when the task touches publisher PDFs or DOI batches.

## Safety

- Keep CloakBrowser visible for SSO, CAPTCHA, WAF, Cloudflare, and publisher verification.
- After clicking PDF, institutional access, OpenAthens/Shibboleth/CARSI, cookie prompts, or verification prompts, inspect a screenshot before concluding success or failure.
- Visible UI fallback may click public publisher controls such as `Access through your organization`, institution search results, or PDF viewer `Download`, but never fill passwords, OTPs, or account credentials.
- Do not manually call private or local notification scripts.
- Never write notification endpoints, tokens, institution credentials, cookies, or other secrets into docs, code, logs, skills, or commits.
