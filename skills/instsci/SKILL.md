# instsci

## Core Rule

Use this self-contained skill as the project entry point for normal InstSci CLI work. A source checkout is required only for development tasks.

## Startup

1. For normal CLI use, work from the user's research project or chosen output directory; do not require an InstSci source checkout.
2. For code changes, locate the checkout containing `AGENTS.md` and `pyproject.toml`, work from that root, and read `AGENTS.md` first. When a checkout is already present during publisher work, also treat its `AGENTS.md` and `instsci/data/*.json` as authoritative.
3. For continuation, recall, migration, or "previous task" questions, use the `chatmem` skill/MCP first when it is available. Treat indexed history as evidence, not approved startup rules.
4. For publisher PDF, closed-access, institution-login, or capability-matrix tasks, also read `instsci/data/institutional_identity_policy.json` or run:

```powershell
instsci identity-policy
```

## MCP Coordination

When InstSci MCP tools are available, use them as the structured context bridge before reading raw JSON files by hand:

- `get_institutional_identity_policy`: load route-selection policy before closed-access planning.
- `get_publisher_access_catalog`: inspect publisher route templates, login hints, persistence stores, and HTTP preflight limits.
- `get_publisher_capability_summary`: inspect the public route-planning summary; it contains no browser or entitlement verdicts.
- `plan_publisher_pdf_workflow`: build the correct visible CLI command and identify whether a subscription institution is still required.

Use MCP `search_papers`, `get_paper_metadata`, and `fetch_paper` for metadata, Open Access lookup, DOI resolution, or non-final retrieval attempts. For publisher PDF downloads, closed-access verification, capability matrices, or final support verdicts, MCP is planning/context only; the actual evidence must come from the visible CloakBrowser workflow started by `instsci papers`, `instsci publisher-batch`, `PublisherBatchDownloader`, or `ACSCloakBatchDownloader`.

If MCP output and repository files disagree, treat `AGENTS.md` plus `instsci/data/*.json` as the source of truth and mention the mismatch.

## Literature Discovery

When the user starts from a topic, title, author, keyword set, or broad research
question rather than an existing DOI list, read
`references/literature-search-workflow.md` and use the discovery-to-library
path before PDF acquisition:

```powershell
instsci search "research topic" --limit 50 --year 2020- --output <run-dir>\search.json
instsci select <run-dir>\search.json --indices "1,3-8" --output <run-dir>\selected_dois.txt
instsci papers <run-dir>\selected_dois.txt --publisher auto --output <run-dir>\papers
instsci zotero sync <run-dir>\papers --attachment-mode linked_file
```

Keep `legacy` search as the stable default unless the installed CLI explicitly
supports and the user asks for an experimental Search v2 / `hybrid` run. Always
check provider `source_status` before interpreting zero hits, preserve
source-specific citation counts, and let the user review/select search results
before acquiring PDFs.

## Evidence Standard

Final publisher PDF verdicts require the visible built-in CloakBrowser workflow. `curl`, `requests`, DOI resolution, `publisher-doctor`, route construction, logs, DOM state, URLs, and cookie exports are HTTP preflight only.

Accepted browser-backed routes include:

```powershell
instsci papers dois.txt --publisher auto --institution "Institution Name" --output .\runs\papers
instsci publisher-batch dois.txt --publisher acs --institution "Institution Name" --output .\runs\acs
```

Code-level work may use `PublisherBatchDownloader`, `ACSCloakBatchDownloader`, or the same visible built-in browser context.

## Publisher Routing / WAF Loop Preflight

When a publisher page repeatedly returns to a robot check, CAPTCHA, Cloudflare,
Turnstile, or other verification page after the user completes the visible
challenge, treat it first as a routing/session/WAF-loop diagnostic, not as a
signal to keep clicking or to bypass verification.

Safety comes first:

- Never automate, bypass, farm out, or guess CAPTCHA, OTP, password, SSO, or
  human-verification steps.
- Do not promise that routing changes will solve publisher checks. They are a
  diagnostic path only.
- Stop batch retries when verification loops. Record `waf_blocked` or
  `human_verification_required` as appropriate, then inspect routing before
  retrying a small single-DOI run.

Use this decision chain:

```text
Repeated verification loop
-> stop batch retries
-> verify CLI path/version
-> capture browser-doctor state
-> inspect sanitized proxy/connector presence
-> compare article/login/PDF asset route consistency
-> retry one DOI with --mode diagnose
-> if loop persists, record waf_blocked and stop
```

Before continuing a looped publisher run, ask the user or run locally:

```powershell
Get-Command instsci -All
where.exe instsci
python -c "import instsci; print(instsci.__version__); print(instsci.__file__)"

instsci browser-doctor `
  --publisher publisher-name `
  --output .\runs\waf_diagnostic

Get-ChildItem Env: |
  Where-Object { $_.Name -match '^(HTTP|HTTPS|ALL|NO)_PROXY$' } |
  Select-Object Name, @{
    Name = 'Configured'
    Expression = { -not [string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($_.Value) }
  }
```

Do not print, paste, log, or commit full proxy URLs, `.codex/env` contents,
connector URLs, cookies, tokens, or institution-private route details. Report
only whether a route is configured and, when needed, a redacted scheme/host/port
with userinfo, query parameters, and tokens removed. `instsci config-cmd --show`
may expose a connector URL in current releases; if used, inspect it locally and
redact before sharing.

Check whether `.codex/env`, shell environment variables, system proxy settings,
rule-mode VPNs, or local proxy ports are sending publisher traffic through the
wrong exit. Do not treat generic Clash/V2Ray-style proxies such as
`127.0.0.1:7897` as an InstSci campus connector. `--connector-url` is for an
institution-supported connector route, not a generic proxy shortcut.

For any publisher, keep the article domain, institution-login domain, and PDF
asset domain on the intended legal access route when possible. A regular
browser, CloakBrowser, API request, institution SSO page, and signed PDF asset
may not all follow the same proxy rules. If their exit IP or browser state
differs, WAF challenges, institution sessions, or page-generated PDF tokens can
loop or expire.

For Elsevier / ScienceDirect specifically, route consistency often involves:

- `api.elsevier.com`
- `www.sciencedirect.com`
- `auth.elsevier.com`
- `pdf.sciencedirectassets.com`
- `*.elsevier.com`

Direct-first protects the Elsevier API route only. If a workflow falls back to
the visible ScienceDirect browser route, Codex/global proxy settings can still
affect the browser or publisher session unless the user's network rules route
those domains through the intended campus, library, institutional VPN, or other
lawful access path.

After inspecting routing, retry only one DOI first:

```powershell
instsci papers .\one_doi.txt `
  --publisher publisher-name `
  --mode diagnose `
  --watch-browser focus `
  --output .\runs\single_doi_diagnose
```

## Chinese Literature Portals

Treat Chinese literature databases as visible-browser portal workflows, not as
ordinary direct PDF URLs. Inspect support with:

```powershell
instsci chinese-literature-sites
```

- Production default: treat CNKI and Wanfang as the download-verified Chinese
  literature portals. `download_verified_portals` should be `["cnki", "wanfang"]`.
- For Chinese literature batches, use CNKI as the first route and Wanfang as a
  fallback/supplement route. Do not run every record through every portal by
  default: if CNKI downloads and verifies a record, stop there; use Wanfang for
  CNKI misses, capture failures, unavailable access, or explicit Wanfang checks.
- For every Chinese literature portal, require exact-title evidence before
  treating a search hit as the target article. Search pages can contain many
  similar Chinese titles; never download or report success from a related title
  merely because keywords overlap. After capture, still require filename or PDF
  text/title verification before `file_status=success`.
- Batch records may supply `first_author` or an ordered `authors` list;
  `first_author` takes precedence. Only the first author is used for searching
  and disambiguation. If an exact title appears in more than one result row,
  extract an ordered author list from explicit same-row author nodes and compare
  only its first entry. A later coauthor never counts; if order is unreliable,
  record `ambiguous_search_result` with `result_evidence=browser_verified` and
  do not click or download. For CNKI, record_id never overrides an exact-title mismatch.
  When author matching selects the result, require the same author in the
  title-adjacent first-page signature; body, acknowledgement, and reference
  occurrences do not count.
- CNKI and Wanfang share one local attempt ledger for atomic locking and audit,
  not a default shared hard limit. The default combined warning threshold is
  100, but it is a conservative InstSci reminder rather than a uniform official
  portal limit. Default hard limits are unset. Users or institutions may set a
  combined limit, a CNKI limit, a Wanfang limit, or a per-command override.
  Reserve immediately before every browser download action; failures and retries
  count. Stop at `daily_limit_reached` only when an explicitly configured hard
  limit is reached. Treat a missing, locked, corrupt, or unwritable ledger as
  `quota_state_error` and fail closed. The ledger covers only InstSci activity
  on this installation and local calendar day, not manual downloads, other
  machines, or other users behind the same institutional exit IP. Keep the
  default inter-download delays and stop on visible verification; never probe
  for a portal limit by deliberately downloading until a block appears.
  Configure policy with `instsci config-cmd --chinese-warning-threshold N`,
  `--chinese-combined-daily-limit N`, `--cnki-daily-limit N`, or
  `--wanfang-daily-limit N`; each hard limit also has a corresponding `--no-*`
  removal option. Batch commands accept `--daily-limit N` for a temporary
  portal limit and `--no-daily-limit` to disable configured hard limits for that
  command while retaining reminders and audit.
  Use `instsci chinese-quota status` to inspect per-portal counts, policy, and
  lock ownership. Use
  `instsci chinese-quota repair` only for its PID-checked stale-lock repair; it
  must refuse active or unparseable locks.
- CNKI is the primary Chinese full-text route: use the persistent CNKI profile
  and the search-first batch path (`instsci cnki-batch ... --navigation-mode search`).
  Before exact-title and first-author evaluation, require visible relevance sorting
  to be active. If the sort control is missing or never becomes active, fail
  closed without selecting a result, reserving an attempt, or starting a download.
  In search mode, records need `record_id` and `title`; `url` is optional and
  used only as a fallback. Direct mode still requires a validated CNKI URL.
  Prefer homepage/search-result navigation before saved detail URLs because
  direct article/download URLs are more likely to trigger click-word verification.
  When CNKI search opens a detail page, confirm the visible detail-page title or
  captured PDF text matches the requested title before marking success.
  Single-record `cnki-fetch` needs `--title` or a text-visible record id before
  a captured PDF can be marked `file_status=success`; otherwise keep it
  `unverified/pdf_candidate_conflict`.
- After changing Chinese-portal selectors or identity logic, use a visible-browser
  smoke test with one duplicate exact title: run one true-first-author positive
  selection and one later-coauthor negative selection. Store screenshots and
  manifests under the external runtime directory, verify negative cases consume
  no quota, and never turn this check into a bulk download.
- Wanfang is a browser-verified search-download route: start at
  `s.wanfangdata.com.cn`, click the result-row `下载` control, and capture the
  PDF from the `Fulltext/Download` popup. Keep this flow in the same visible
  browser context because the popup URL is generated per session. Wanfang uses
  its own persistent profile by default. For batches, use
  `instsci wanfang-batch records.json --output .\runs\wanfang`.
  Wanfang requires a stricter list-page guard because downloads are triggered
  directly from search-result rows: click a `下载` control only when the same
  result row contains the exact requested title. A page-level title match,
  nearby title text, or similar keyword result is not enough. If no exact row is
  visible, do not download a similar candidate; mark the record `missing` or
  `capture_failed` with `next_action=inspect_wanfang_search_results_or_refine_query`.
  A valid PDF whose title/text cannot be tied to the requested record remains
  `unverified/pdf_candidate_conflict`, never `success`.
- CQVIP is a manual broker only, not download-verified. The visible route can
  reach a `www.cqvip.com` article page and `PDF下载`; manual `IP登录` can redirect
  to `qikan.cqvip.com`, but qikan rendered blank in CloakBrowser and HTTP
  preflight showed CQVIP cache-server 403/412 challenge responses. The tested
  institution resource portal did not visibly list CQVIP, so entitlement is
  unconfirmed. Do not force CQVIP automation or include it in default Chinese
  literature batch downloads unless qikan page load and institution entitlement
  are freshly browser-verified.
- SinoMed and Duxiu/Chaoxing remain planned portal profiles until
  screenshot-backed CloakBrowser runs verify their route and blocker states.
- Prefer homepage/search-result navigation before saved article detail URLs for
  every Chinese literature portal. Avoid parallel tabs until a portal is
  browser-verified and rate behavior is known.
- If CAPTCHA, SSO, reader checks, delivery flows, or other human verification
  appear, let the user complete them in the visible browser. CNKI/Wanfang page
  classifiers should distinguish `auth_required` from human verification and
  `capture_failed`. Do not auto-solve, bypass, export cookies, or treat
  HTTP-only probes as final download evidence.
- For Chinese records without DOI, Zotero handoff should use
  `attachment_only` when `zotero_item_key` and a verified PDF are present;
  do not skip them as `missing_doi`.
- When building Chinese literature batches from Zotero, preserve
  `zotero_item_key` in each record and manifest row. Use title first, then year,
  author, and publication metadata when available to judge exactness. Do not
  assume a Chinese Zotero title is present in both CNKI and Wanfang.

## Elsevier API Setup

For Elsevier or ScienceDirect DOI retrieval, guide the user to configure a global Elsevier API key once:

```powershell
instsci elsevier-setup --api-key YOUR_ELSEVIER_KEY --validate
```

- The key is global InstSci config, not per article; `--test-doi` is validation only.
- Inst Token is optional. Configure `--inst-token` only when the user's library explicitly provides an Elsevier institutional token.
- The preferred API route is `view=FULL XML -> object/eid -> PDF`.
- Use direct-first routing so `api.elsevier.com` can use campus, school VPN, rule VPN, or library exit before any configured proxy fallback.
- Do not write API keys, Inst Tokens, cookies, or entitlement details into docs, logs, skill files, or commits.
- API success is HTTP preflight/API-route evidence. Final publisher PDF verdicts still require visible CloakBrowser evidence when the task asks for closed-access publisher capability.

## Institution Route

- Do not default to Example University or any other school.
- Resolve subscription institution in this order: explicit `--institution`, `config.carsi_idp_name`, `config.institution_name_en`, `config.institution_name_zh`, `config.school`, then ask the user.
- When the public placeholder directory does not contain the user's institution, use MCP `configure_institution` or the CLI institution-name options instead of requiring a directory entry.
- Prefer publisher broker, Shibboleth, OpenAthens, CARSI, or configured WAYFless institution links before WebVPN.
- Use WebVPN only when the configured institution has a WebVPN gateway and that route is browser-verified for the publisher.
- Do not treat `cookies.json` or `carsi_cookie_dir/*.json` as a full reusable login state; they are preflight/supporting assets, not final evidence.

## Reporting

For publisher PDF work, report each DOI or publisher with `publisher`, `doi`, `route_attempted`, `institution`, `file_status`, `standard_status`, `result_evidence`, `evidence`, and `next_action`.

Use the three-layer status contract:

- `file_status`: file outcome only. Allowed values are `success`, `unverified`, and `missing`.
- `standard_status`: user/workflow meaning. Common values are `success`, `auth_required`, `access_unavailable`, `waf_blocked`, `human_verification_required`, `publisher_error`, `capture_failed`, `unsupported_publisher`, and `pdf_candidate_conflict`.
- `result_evidence`: how the result was established. Allowed values are `oa_direct`, `publisher_open_pdf`, `browser_verified`, `http_preflight`, and `not_verified`.

For final manifests, keep Markdown, CSV, and JSON counts consistent. `file_status=success` means downloaded and verified; `file_status=unverified` means a PDF exists but DOI/text verification is insufficient; `file_status=missing` means no PDF was captured. HTTP-only findings are never final closed-access verdicts; final publisher conclusions require `result_evidence=browser_verified`.

## Zotero Sync

When the user starts from a topic rather than an existing DOI list, use the
Literature Discovery workflow first, then sync only reviewed and acquired
results.

After `papers` or `publisher-batch` writes a run manifest, keep Zotero as the long-term paper entry point:

```powershell
instsci zotero handoff .\runs\papers --tags project/my-topic --collections "Collection Name"
instsci zotero sync .\runs\papers --attachment-mode linked_file
```

`handoff` builds the reviewable action queue. `sync` creates or matches the Zotero item, links the matching local PDF as a `linked_file` attachment, writes `zotero_item_key` and `zotero_attachment_key` back into the InstSci manifest, and writes `zotero_sync_report.json`.

Default sync behavior includes only `standard_status=success` rows and requires an existing PDF. Zotero remains clean: item plus PDF attachment only. Do not create Zotero child notes, evidence notes, or process logs.

Use Zotero Storage uploads only when the user explicitly wants imported attachments and has enough Zotero storage. The stable default is `linked_file`, which also works well with Zotero Attanger-style local attachment management.

## Workflow Plan

After a run with failures or unresolved rows, generate a structured next-step acquisition plan:

```powershell
instsci workflow-plan .\runs\papers
```

`workflow-plan` reads the manifest, excludes success rows by default, and writes `workflow_plan.json` beside the manifest. Each attention item keeps the existing `next_action` and adds machine-readable `suggested_paths`, such as `oa_retry`, `library_resolver`, `ill_request`, `author_email`, `rerun_diagnose`, or `manual_browser_single_doi`.

Use this plan to decide the next research workflow. Keep Zotero focused on items and PDFs; keep acquisition process state in InstSci manifests and reports.

## Publisher Matrix

Before running large closed-access batches, inspect publisher readiness with the matrix panel:

```powershell
instsci publisher-doctor --matrix
```

`publisher-doctor --matrix` is a planning view, not a fresh access verdict. It summarizes the canonical public capability summary with `ready`, `prewarm_required`, `waf_risky`, `route_not_published`, `unclassified`, `batch_recommendation`, `known_blocker`, and machine-readable `suggested_paths`.

Use this panel to decide whether to run a normal batch, run a single-DOI prewarm first, switch to a manual browser check, retry later, or avoid a bulk run. For final publisher PDF verdicts, still use the visible CloakBrowser-backed workflow.

## Public and Private Evidence

Treat `instsci/data/*.json` as distributable route knowledge or anonymized
planning summaries only. Keep institution-specific screenshots, subscription
observations, run paths, cookies, and browser state outside the repository.

Use `instsci evidence policy` to inspect the boundary. When a private run needs
long-term traceability, use `instsci evidence register RUN_DIR`; this creates a
reference-only entry under `~/.instsci/private-evidence` with a manifest hash and
does not copy PDFs, screenshots, cookies, or browser profiles. Never publish the
private index. Any proposed public summary must be separately anonymized and pass
`instsci public-audit`.

## Detailed Reference

For literature search, selection, provider status, Search v2 rollout, and
discovery-to-Zotero routing, read
`references/literature-search-workflow.md`. For recent publisher gotchas,
publisher-specific notes, visible-browser UI fallback steps, report-count rules,
and verification commands, read `references/publisher-pdf-workflow.md` when the
task touches publisher PDFs or DOI batches.

## Safety

- Keep CloakBrowser visible for SSO, CAPTCHA, WAF, Cloudflare, and publisher verification.
- After clicking PDF, institutional access, OpenAthens/Shibboleth/CARSI, cookie prompts, or verification prompts, inspect a screenshot before concluding success or failure.
- Visible UI fallback may click public publisher controls such as `Access through your organization`, institution search results, or PDF viewer `Download`, but never fill passwords, OTPs, or account credentials.
- Do not manually call private or local notification scripts.
- Never write notification endpoints, tokens, institution credentials, cookies, or other secrets into docs, code, logs, skills, or commits.
